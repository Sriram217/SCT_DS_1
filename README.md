Bar Chart Visualization of World Population

A bar chart visualization of world population presents data in vertical bars, with each bar representing the population of a specific country or region. 

The length or height of the bars corresponds to the population size, making it easy to compare across different countries. 

Typically, the x-axis lists the countries or regions, while the y-axis shows population numbers.
